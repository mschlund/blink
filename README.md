# blink
Blinking the onboard-LED of an Arduino-Board using the new language "Blech"

see https://www.blech-lang.org/ for 

## Building
Compile the Blech-program by executing the Makefile:
```
$ make
```
This generates two files, "blink.c" and "blink.h" in the directory.
Use vscode with the Arduino-extension or the Arduino-IDE to build and flash the blink.ino wrapper.
